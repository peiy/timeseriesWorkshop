The game industry presents a very interesting source of challenges to machine learning methods and algorithms.  Games continuously collect data about the basic actions of players, and from that raw data, companies would like to extract actionable information to both delight players with better game experiences, and improve business metrics. In this paper we explore an approach to address a key enabler to understand players' behaviors. Given the players time series with raw data about  their  actions, (1) what are the latent states that govern that behavior, and (2) what are the natural clusters of players given the latent state dynamics.   Out approach is based on using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to identify the basic players latent states, and then use a clustering method based on Dirichlet Process to group the players according to the time series of these latent states. We present our preliminary results on real data taken from  one of the strategy games developed by Zynga Inc.\
