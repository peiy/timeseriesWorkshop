The game industry presents a very interesting source of challenges to 
machine learning methods and algorithms.  Games continuously collect data 
about the basic actions of players. Such data are very useful for the game 
developers to extract actionable information, in order to both delight 
players with better game experiences and improve business metrics. 
In this paper, we explore an approach to address a key enabler for understanding 
player behaviors . Given players' time series raw data about 
their actions, our goal is to identify (1) what are the latent states that 
govern that behavior, and (2) what are the natural clusters of players given their 
latent state dynamics. Our approach is based on employing Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to 
identify the basic latent states of the players, and then use a clustering method 
based on Dirichlet Process to group the players according to their time series 
of the latent states. We present our preliminary results on real data taken 
from one of the strategy games developed by Zynga Inc.
