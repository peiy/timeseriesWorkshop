There exists a few work on clustering time series data with HMM model, such as
\cite{Bicego2006,bicego2003,coviello2014}. Most of the work focus on finding
out the final clustering result, while we are also interested in studying
the underlying states of each player at each time period. To our knowledge, 
we are not aware of any work on clustering time series data in the game domain.
The most related work in the game domain is \cite{menendez2014},
where gamers' time series data are used to extract the user profile.
However, the task considered there is different with our paper.
